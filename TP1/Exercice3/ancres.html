        Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language[1] for creating a
        webpage. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser. They can include
        writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML is used to mark
        and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can
        display them correctly. HTML can also be used to add meta information to
        a webpage. Meta information is usually not shown by web browsers and is
        data about the web page, e.g., the name of the person who created the
        page. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to style HTML elements while
        JavaScript is used to manipulate HTML elements and CSS styles.

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the
        separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
        fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide
        more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
        characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce
        complexity and repetition in the structural content.

        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a
        high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the
        ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
        typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of
        the World Wide Web.[9] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
        an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use
        it,[10] and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
        execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports
        event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and
        prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text,
        arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself
        does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded
        to provide these features
